# CERVICAL CANCER RISK ANALYSIS
## Background

*AI Camp - The Data Science Crash Course Project*

- In this project, we applied techniques of Machine Learning and Data Science to identify behavioral patterns of Cervical Cancer, which put women at a greater risk. Feature importance will be leveraged to construct risk profiles, generation of such risk profiles will help healthcare institutions/doctors to identify at risk individuals who should receive immediate attention and a more tailored health plan.
- Coding Language: Python for ML/DS, Flask; Javascript/HTML/CSS for bootstrap.
- ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost.
- Dataset: [Cervical Cancer Data](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=42912&status=active)

## Quick Start
**Dependencies**: 

MapBox API

**Functions**: 

1）Add Singapore's region dividing line, fill each region with color based on the number of its confirmed cases. The darker the color, the more severe the epidemic situation.

2）Place a scrollbar at the top-left corner to check the epidemic information from a week ago to two weeks later by scrolling the bar.

3）Click a certain region to view the number of its confirmed cases, suspected cases as well as the estimated outbreak time. Also the total number of cases (for the past week) and the estimated level of risk (for the following two weeks) are provided.

4）Click a certain region to view its most related three regions, which are connected with lines. The darker the color of the line, the higher the correlation coefficient. 

5）The info box at the top-right corner shows the date, total population and the summary of the epidemic situation. The information change synchronously with the scrollbar.

## Demo3
**Dependencies**: 

MapBox API

**Functions**: 

1）Locate every confirmed case on the map and make thermodynamic diagrams based on the density of confirmed cases.

2）Add Singapore's region dividing line, click a certain region to view the number of its confirmed cases.

3）Place a scrollbar at the top-left corner to check the epidemic information from a week ago to two weeks later by scrolling the bar.

4）The info box at the top-right corner shows the date, total population and the summary of the epidemic situation. The information change synchronously with the scrollbar.
